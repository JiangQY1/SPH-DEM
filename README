NOTE: I have mostly stopped supporting and updating SPH-DEM, in favor of its successor, Aboria. This is a general-purpose particle simulation code which can be used to quickly implement any particle-based algorithm, including SPH, DEM or SPH-DEM. Please see Aboria's github page for more details:

Please see the bundled user manual (user_manual.pdf) for more detailed information.
